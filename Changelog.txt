###Post-Demo Version Development###
Moving into further development of the demo version, will be adding dict's of player inventories that track throughout each playthrough.
Items will be used in events. 
Adding possible dialogue options based on stat prerequisites. Possible race-based interactions. We'll see.
Plans to add alignment based decisions upon leaving tavern and exploring into the world.

Possible experience system, very low priority though.
I think that's all for now. 
Thanks for reading.

6/6/2020 UPDATE
Tracking inventories have been added
Items now utilized in events
First dialogue option added 
The update begins to expand past the events of the tavern as our hero (or not) heads into the forest.

I plan on expanding and finishing the forest area soon. I have a few ideas and we will see how they develop.
I would really like to begin using the alignment system thats implimented and branch the story there. Options may be added soon.
That's all for now.
Thanks for reading.
