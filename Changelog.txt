###Post-Demo Version Development###
Moving into further development of the demo version, will be adding dict's of player inventories that track throughout each playthrough.
Items will be used in events. 
Adding possible dialogue options based on stat prerequisites. Possible race-based interactions. We'll see.
Plans to add alignment based decisions upon leaving tavern and exploring into the world.

Possible experience system, very low priority though.
I think that's all for now. 
Thanks for reading.
