Hello, if you're reading this then you found my Choose Your Adventure game, or I sent it to you, and you're nice enough to read the README.
This game is a small passion project of mine that I will be working on and updating/expanding for the foreseeable future.
I am just an amateur coder with not the greatest experience who woke up one morning with this idea, sat down, and started typing.
The overall idea of the game is a Dungeons and Dragons inspired system except as a randomized, text-based, roguelike game.
As of right now you are able to create your character with your preferred name, gender, race, and alignment and each story starts off the same, though each playthrough will be different I assure you.
I wanted to create a demo version that highlighted the kind of "gameplay" one could expect while playing, though it will become more complex as decisions mount. 
Currently featured in the demo version is 7 possible "endings" (where I decided to cut the demo) with only one being a potential true ending of the game, regardless of version it is. 
The other 6 "endings" are very similar in terms of conclusion but that is due to the linear nature of what the character must do. 

I know the game is quite short for the moment but I believe that each ending works the way it is intended. 
If you do happen to run into an error please do not hesitate to point it out to me.
I appreciate the time you've taken to read this and the time you've taken/will take to play the game.
Goodbye :)
